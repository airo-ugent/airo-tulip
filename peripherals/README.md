# Peripherals

This folder contains code that should run on the Teensy microcontroller that controls the peripherals and a client
for the server to communicate with the Teensy.

Do not use `./peripherals_server` (deprecated but kept for historic reasons), instead consider
`./peripherals_server_teensy` for the Teensy microcontroller integration.
